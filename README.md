## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I had my first project in JavaScript, it is a little complicate but with time i will get it.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div>DIV</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I think i have to study much more about coding in JavaScript.
